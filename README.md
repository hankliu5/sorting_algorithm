# Sorting Algorithm

Since I am currently taking CSE 21 - "Algorithm" in UCSD, I decide to rearrange and put the scripts
of sorting algorithm I made before for the Data Structure course together.

Right now there are bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort and selection sort.

Maybe the next step is I can create a simple interface through the terminal and make it allow users to
choose which sorting algorithm they want to use and the input array they want to run.
